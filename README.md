This project takes any inputted image and allows the user to edit the image to their liking. The pixels of the image are painted in a 2D Array, allowing the image to be manipulated. 
From there, various methods are constructed to change what the image looks like visually. Examples are rotating the image, changing the color contrast, black/white, etc. Inputs are controlled by
inputs from the user.
